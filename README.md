- 👋 Hey I’m Ashutosh, a software engineer with a primary expertise in TypeScript (and JS)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web UX, DevX and Software Engineering as a whole.
- 🌱 I’m passively learning Rust and Go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TS based open source libs 
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach out to me on ashutosh.kaushik1999@gmail.com
- PS. I'd been using a different work account from early 2022 to late 2023 (https://github.com/kashuSpext) thus the lack of activity on this account.
